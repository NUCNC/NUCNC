Welcome to Northwestern University Computational Neuroscience Club (NUCNC).<br>
<br>
We meet on alternate Mondays 5-6PM to learn and discuss computational and theoretical neuroscience. Meetings include (but are not limited to) article/book chapter discussions, hackathons, tutorials, white board and round table discussions and invited talks. Meetings take place simultaneously on Evanston (Tech L251) and Chicago (Wieboldt 421) campuses (coordinated via videoconferencing) and are open to all NU PhD students, post-docs and faculty members interested/involved in computational neuroscience.

**Upcoming event**<br>
*February 11, 2019, 5PM, Neural encoding and decoding in MATLAB, Vivek Sagar* <br>
For the first half of the discussion, we will briefly discuss principles of neural encoding and decoding based on the following [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612306650310).
Second half of the discussion will be based on practically implementing these models in MATLAB. We will construct an encoder (and decoder) for mapping spatial position to neural activity (and vice-versa) in MECII grid cells in freely behaving rats. For this we will use the following [dataset](https://archive.norstore.no/pages/public/datasetDetail.jsf?id=8F6BE356-3277-475C-87B1-C7A977632DA7).
Prerequisites: basic probability theory, coding in MATLAB
