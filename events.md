**Recurrent Neural Networks for Continuous Neural Decoding, Maite Azcorra Sedano**<br>
In this session we will discuss the challenges of predicting continuous variables from neural activity, and the benefits of Recurrent Neural Networks to approach this problem. We will briefly introduce different methods for sequence-to-sequence prediction based on the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1708/1708.00909.pdf), focusing on Recurrent Neural Networks, and in particular on LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) networks. We will then discuss important steps to take when implementing a neural network, such as cross validation, data preprocessing, optimization of parameters, etc. We will also look at real life examples of successes and failures of LSTM prediction, implemented in Python.<br>
Prerequisites: Interest in Machine Learning!<br>

**Big data and data science in neuroscience, Torben Noto**<br>
I'd like to talk about 'big data' and data science in neuroscience. Publicly available neuroscience datasets are rapidly becoming available but actually using these datasets can be tricky. I'm going to introduce a few of these datasets, some successful projects that have used these datasets, as well as some tips and tricks for people interested in using them in the future.

**White Matter Tractography in DTI, Shiloh Cooper**<br>
Diffusion MRI is sensitive to water movements through tissues, and is used to characterize tissue structure based on the restriction of water movement. One example is white matter tractography, where the water pathways are assumed to travel in the same directions as bundles of axons traveling between cortical regions of interest. How can we create an accurate tractography algorithm (i.e., one that does not "jump" from one white matter tract to another when they cross within a voxel) without using anatomical priors and biasing the algorithm?

**Neural encoding and decoding in MATLAB, Vivek Sagar** <br>
For the first half of the discussion, we will briefly discuss principles of neural encoding and decoding based on the following [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612306650310).
Second half of the discussion will be based on practically implementing these models in MATLAB. We will construct an encoder (and decoder) for mapping spatial position to neural activity (and vice-versa) in MECIII grid cells in freely behaving rats. For this we will use the following [dataset](https://archive.norstore.no/pages/public/datasetDetail.jsf?id=8F6BE356-3277-475C-87B1-C7A977632DA7).
Prerequisites: basic probability theory, coding in MATLAB
