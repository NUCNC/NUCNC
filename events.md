**Big data and data science in neuroscience, Torben Noto**<br>
"Big Data" and "Data science" are concepts that have gained considerable attention over the last few years but have unclear definitions and are not traditionally taught in academic circles. In the first part of this talk I will first introduce some basic ideas in data science in a way that will hopefully separate its rhetoric from its value and potentially think about analyzing your data in new ways. Data science is becoming especially important as publicly available neuroscience datasets like the Allen Brain Atlas rapidly emerge. These datasets provide many exciting opportunities in research. However, using these datasets can be tricky. In the second part of this talk we'll discuss some of these datasets as well as the basics of using them. In the final part of the talk, we'll use what we've learned to discuss the [methods paper behind Neurosynth](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1635), a metascientific fMRI mapping tool.

**Neural Manifolds for the Control of Movement, Prof. Sara Solla**<br>
The analysis of neural dynamics in several brain cortices has consistently uncovered low-dimensional manifolds that capture a significant fraction of neural variability. These neural manifolds are spanned by specific patterns of correlated neural activity, the ‘‘neural modes.’’ We discuss a [model for neural control of movement](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317304634?via%3Dihub) in which the time-dependent activation of these neural modes is the generator of motor behavior. This manifold-based view of motor cortex may lead to a better understanding of how the brain controls movement.

**White Matter Tractography in DTI, Shiloh Cooper**<br>
Diffusion MRI is sensitive to water movements through tissues, and is used to characterize tissue structure based on the restriction of water movement. One example is white matter tractography, where the water pathways are assumed to travel in the same directions as bundles of axons traveling between cortical regions of interest. How can we create an accurate tractography algorithm (i.e., one that does not "jump" from one white matter tract to another when they cross within a voxel) without using anatomical priors and biasing the algorithm?

**Recurrent Neural Networks for Continuous Neural Decoding, Maite Azcorra Sedano**<br>
In this session we will discuss the challenges of predicting continuous variables from neural activity. We will introduce different methods to approach this problem and focus on LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) recurrent neural networks and their benefits. We will also discuss important things to keep in mind when implementing such networks, such as cross validation, data preprocessing, optimization of hyperparameters etc. We will finally over some real life examples of how to (and not to) implement LSTMs to predict mouse behavior from GCaMP neuronal activity.<br>
Prerequisites: Interest in Machine Learning!<br>

**Neural encoding and decoding in MATLAB, Vivek Sagar** <br>
For the first half of the discussion, we will briefly discuss principles of neural encoding and decoding based on the following [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612306650310). Second half of the discussion will be based on practically implementing these models in MATLAB. We will construct an encoder (and decoder) for mapping spatial position to neural activity (and vice-versa) in MECIII grid cells in freely behaving rats. For this we will use the following [dataset](https://archive.norstore.no/pages/public/datasetDetail.jsf?id=8F6BE356-3277-475C-87B1-C7A977632DA7) and [codes](https://github.com/viveksgr/NUCNC_demo/tree/master/Scripts) for analysis.
Prerequisites: basic probability theory, coding in MATLAB
